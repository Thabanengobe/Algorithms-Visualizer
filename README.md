# Sort Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
The Sort Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users learn and understand various sorting algorithms through visualization. 
Created as a hands-on project, it provides a dynamic platform to visualize the inner workings of popular sorting methods like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Purpose
This project serves two primary purposes: it enhances my understanding of sorting algorithms by allowing me to experiment with their implementations, 
and it acts as a valuable reference for revising these algorithms in the future.

By combining education with interactivity, this visualizer not only solidifies my knowledge but also helps others grasp 
the concepts of sorting algorithms in an engaging way.
